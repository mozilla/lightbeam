# Lightbeam for Firefox README

This is an add-on for Firefox that helps to visualize sites that may be tracking you around the internet. The add-on is available from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lightbeam/.


## Prerequisites

* [Mozilla Add-on SDK][ASDK]
* [Firefox 18][] or higher.

If you only want to see the demo, you don't need any of these; all you need is a modern browser.

## Quick Start

First, [install][] the Mozilla Add-on SDK if you haven't already, and activate it in a command line terminal.

    cd addon-sdk
    source bin/activate

Then, check out the Lightbeam repository and enter it (do this where you want the lightbeam directory, not in the addon-sdk directory):

    git clone git://github.com/mozilla/lightbeam.git
    cd lightbeam

Finally, run:

    cfx run

This will start Firefox with a temporary profile that has Lightbeam installed. Just click on the Lightbeam icon at the bottom-right of the browser window to open the web front-end.

At this point, any changes you make to the web front-end simply require reloading the tab containing it. Changing the add-on, however, will require quitting Firefox and running `cfx run` again.
